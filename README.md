# RedditSentimentAnalysisBot

This is a bot that utilizes the reddit API to scrape comments off of any user selected subreddit and calculate the comment's polarity and subjectivity using the python library TextBlob.

To run the bot: Run main and enter the name of the subreddit you want to analyze. 

The script will then return a plot between polarity and subjectivity and make a prediction using the linear regression model. The bot also returns the pearson correlation of comment polarity and subjectivity
